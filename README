This repository is modified source code of
http://genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/genesis-ftp/genesis-2.4-src.tar.gz . This is not
an OFFICIAL release. 


This repo is used to build genesis packages on open build service.

https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:dilawar/genesis

If you install the package, you have to do the following:

    $ cp /etc/genesis/simrc ~/.simrc

Open the file and update the variables (if neccessary). I did not test the
package exhaustively. If you find an error, do report on issues.
